/**
 * Sparse vectors and their operations. This package provides a sparse vector
 * framework for storing things such as rating vectors. Sparse vectors are
 * stored efficiently and have a key domain fixed at create time. Storage is
 * linear in the size of the key domain. See
 * {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.vectors.SparseVector} for more details.
 *
 * <p>
 * To allow the type system to communicate valuable information about how
 * vectors are used while still preserving efficiency, sparse vectors come in
 * three forms: <em>read-only</em>, realized by
 * {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.vectors.SparseVector}, provides the basic sparse
 * vector interface; <em>read-write</em>, in
 * {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.vectors.MutableSparseVector}, provides an
 * interface where the values can be changed (e.g. for in-place addition or
 * subtraction); and <em>immutable</em>, in
 * {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.vectors.ImmutableSparseVector}, where the vector
 * is guaranteed to be unchanging and can be safely stored or shared across
 * threads without concern about the caller mutating it later.
 *
 * <p>
 * There are further versions of immutable vectors with particular information
 * associated with them: {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.data.history.ItemVector},
 * {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.data.history.UserVector}, and their subclasses.
 * These classes are used for vectors of data associated with particular users.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.vectors.SparseVector SparseVector} class
 * also provides utility methods for manipulating sparse vectors (e.g. the
 * {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.vectors.SparseVector#immutable()
 * SparseVector.immutable()} method for getting an immutable sparse vector).
