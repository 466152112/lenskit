/**
 * Main entry point for accessing recommender components.  A recommender object
 * is effectively a recommender <i>session</i>: it is a per-thread or per-request
 * object, likely connected to a database connection or persistence session, that
 * needs to be closed when the client code is finished with it.
 * <p/>
 * <p>The various methods in this class return <var>null</var> if the corresponding
 * operation is not supported by the underlying recommender configuration.  This
 * ensures that, if you can actually get an object implementing a particular interface,
 * you are guaranteed to be able to use it.
