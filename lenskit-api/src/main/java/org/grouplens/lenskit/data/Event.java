 * (such as login/logout events). We recommend that integrators use a designated
 * item ID in such cases.  If that item type never shows up in events used by
 * recommenders, then it should not affect the recommenders.
 *
 * <p>
 * Events should be immutable. Deviations must be clearly documented and only
 * used in a few cases (e.g. to implement fast iterators). The {@link #copy()}
 * should return an immutable event.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations must also have well-defined {@link #equals(Object)} and
 * {@link #hashCode()} methods.
