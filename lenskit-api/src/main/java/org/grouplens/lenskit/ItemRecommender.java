/**
 * Interface for recommending items. Several methods are provided, of varying
 * generality.
 * <p>
 * The core idea of the recommend API is to recommend <i>n</i> items for a user,
 * where the items recommended are taken from a set of candidate items and
 * further constrained by an exclude set of forbidden items. Items in the
 * candidate set but not in the exclude set are considered viable for
 * recommendation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As with {@link ItemScorer}, this interface supports both ID-based and
 * history-based recommendation. The {@link #canUseHistory()} method allows this
 * to be queried.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default, the candidate set is the universe of all items the recommender
 * knows about. The default exclude set is somewhat more subtle. Its exact
 * definition varies across implementations, but will be the set of items the
 * system believes the user will not be interested in by virtue of already
 * having or knowing about them. For example, rating-based recommenders will
 * exclude the items the user has rated, and purchase-based recommenders will
 * typically exclude items the user has purchased. Some implementations may
 * allow this to be configured. Client code always has the option of manually
 * specifying the exclude set, however, so applications with particular needs in
 * this respect can manually provide the sets they need respected.
 * </p>
