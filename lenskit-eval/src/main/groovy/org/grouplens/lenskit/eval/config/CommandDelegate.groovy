/**
 * Default Groovy delegate for configuring commands of evaluator components. It wraps
 * a {@link Command}, and dispatches methods as follows:
 * <p/>
 * To resolve "foo", this delegate first looks for a method "setFoo", then "addFoo", such that one
 * of the following holds:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The method takes the parameters specified.</li>
 *     <li>The parameters specified can be converted into appropriate types
 *     for the method by wrapping strings with {@code File} objects and instantiating
 *     classes with their default constructors.</li>
 *     <li>The method takes a single parameter annotated with the {@link BuilderCommand}
 *     annotation. This command is constructed using a constructor that matches the arguments
 *     provided, except that the last argument is ommitted if it is a {@link Closure}. If the
 *     last argument is a {@link Closure}, it is used to configure the command with an appropriate
 *     delegate before the object is built.</li>
 * </ul>
