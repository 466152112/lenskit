RefLens
=======

RefLens is an implementation of collaborative filtering algorithms and
a set of tools for benchmarking them.

.. warning::
   RefLens is currently undergoing heavy development.  Interfaces and
   APIs are subject to change.

Packages
--------

RefLens is comprised of three packages.

``reflens``
  The top-level ``reflens`` package serves as a parent to collect the
  other base RefLens packages.  Building it will build all
  components of RefLens.
``reflens-core``
  This package contains the core APIs and recommender implementations.
``reflens-bench``
  This package contains the benchmarking program.

Installation and Dependency Management
--------------------------------------

RefLens is managed and deployed via Maven_ [1]_.  To install it, check out
this repository and run ``mvn install``.  It can also be checked out
in Eclipse with M2Eclipse_ by using the “Check out Maven projects from
SCM” import option; select ‘hg’, provide the BitBucket repository
location and make sure the “Check out All projects” option is
selected.  The NetBeans Maven support should be similarly usable but
has not been tested.

.. _M2Eclipse: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/installing-m2eclipse.html

RefLens depends on fastutil_.  Unfortunately, an appropriate version
of fastutil is not available from the Maven central repositories.  We
provide a Mavenized version.  There are two options to make fastutil
available for use in RefLens:

- Add http://elehack.net/maven to your list of Maven repositories;
  Maven will then download and install fastutil from there as needed.
- Check out the `Mavenized fastutil`_ from Bitbucket and run
  ``mvn install`` in its source directory.  This will install it to
  your local repository.

Once Fastutil is installed, Maven will take care of finding it and
downloading all other dependencies for RefLens.

.. [1] On Debian or Ubuntu systems, Maven is available via the
       ``maven2`` package.
