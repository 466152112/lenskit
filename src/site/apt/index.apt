About RefLens

  RefLens is an open-source implementation of recommender algorithms
  with an emphasis on collaborative filtering.  It is developed by
  {{{http://www.grouplens.org}GroupLens Research}}.

  RefLens is currently alpha softare (see
  {{{./versioning.html}Versioning}} for more information).  Please
  download it, try it out, and provide us with feedback on how it
  works for you, but be advised that it is still very much a
  work-in-progress and APIs may change as we gain more experience with
  them and the project stabilizes.

Project Goals

  RefLens is intended to be a reference implementation of common
  collaborative filtering algorithms and a useful starting point for
  recommender systems research and education.

  To support education, we place an emphasis on clean, readable code
  that demonstrates what is necessary to take algorithms from
  mathematical descriptions to actual implementation. RefLens is
  currently in an early alpha state, so the code does not yet live up
  to this standard.  As development progresses, we will be auditing
  the code for readability and documenting it more carefully.  The
  goal is to have the implementation be ready for use in courses on
  adaptive web and recommender technologies or for self-study on
  recommender implementation.

  We also intend RefLens to be a good platform for experimenting with
  new algorithms and evaluation metrics.  There are several specific
  design goals we have to further this objective:

  * A common recommender API covering item rating prediction and item
    recommendation in both rated and rating-free contexts.

    <<Status>>: The rating-based APIs are in place and seem
    to work pretty well.  The rating-free APIs still need development.

  * A highly modular implementation of common algorithms with
    state-of-the-art normalizations and tweaks.  This will provide
    easy access to high-quality implementations of existing algorithms
    to use as a baseline for evaluating new algorithms and a framework
    for testing modifications to individual components of algorithms
    (e.g. testing a new similarity function for item-item
    collaborative filtering).

    <<Status>>: The framework for this is in place and we
    have modular implementations of user-user and item-item
    collaborative filtering.  We also have a gradient descent SVD
    implementation that has not yet had as much refinement.

  * A comprehensive benchmarking tool capable of evaluating any
    compatible recommender algorithm using a variety of offline
    evaluation methods and metrics.

    <<Status>>: We have a leave-N-out crossfold benchmarker
    and the beginnings of a benchmarking framework.  Significant
    further development is needed on this goal.

* Non-goals

  RefLens is not intended to be an industry-strength implementation
  capable of running on a large e-commerce site (although we don't
  mind at all if you use it for that).  It is intended to be useful at
  research and education scales, and suitable for providing
  recommendations in smaller-scale web applications.

Development

  RefLens is developed by GroupLens Research.  Development is hosted
  on {{{https://bitbucket.org/grouplens/reflens}BitBucket}}.
