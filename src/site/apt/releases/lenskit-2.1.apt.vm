* General Changes

  * RNG now configured via dependency injection.

  * <<<Rating>>> class now has <<<hasValue()>>> and <<<getValue()>>> methods for convenience.

  * Recommender engines can now be deserialized with arbitrary class loaders (fixes bugs using
    LensKit in Play, see #issue(434)).

  * Added <<<lenskit-all>>> module so you can easily depend on all of LensKit with a single
    dependency.

  []

* Data Access

  * New methods to more easily construct DAOs (#issue(346))

  []

* Algorithms

  * Updated user-user CF to be simpler & make better use of new DAOs (#issue(356)).

  * Refactored item-item model build:

    * Build the context with a provider rather than injecting a factory.

    * Use the strategy pattern to abstract sparse vs. non-sparse iteration, allowing sparse
      iteration to be disabled by overriding the default provider.

    * Better logging of the item-item model build process.

* Evaluator

  * The evaluator now supports loading algorithms from config files in both train-test
    and graph dumping tasks (#issue(406)).
