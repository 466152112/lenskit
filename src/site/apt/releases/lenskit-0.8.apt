Release 0.8

  The {{{https://bitbucket.org/grouplens/lenskit}Mercurial changelog}} and the
  {{{http://bitbucket.org/grouplens/lenskit/issues?milestone=0.8&status=resolved}list
  of closed tickets}} provide more information on what has happened,
  including bugs that have been fixed.

  * Cleaned up cursor utilities, moving all methods from
    <<<Cursors2>>> to <<<Cursors>>>.  The old <<<Cursors2>>> methods
    are deprecated and will be removed before 1.0 is released.

  * Implemented a new evaluation framework that uses XML files to
    directly configure evaluators (#issue(115)).  This replaces the
    Ant plugin.  Eventually, a Maven plugin will be added that runs
    these evaluations; for now, they can be run with
    {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/exec-maven-plugin}exec-maven-plugin}}.
    See the <<<lenskit-eval-demo>>> project configuration for an
    example.  With this comes the fix for #issue(115) as well.

  * Provide example evaluation configurations run as integration
    tests.  <<<lenskit-eval>>> contains a basic one, and
    <<<lenskit-eval-demo>>> contains a more extensive set complete
    with R-based post-analysis.  To run these, activate the
    <<<smoketest>>> profile and set the
    <<<grouplens.mldata.acknowledge>>> property to <<<yes>>> to
    acknowledge that you are abiding by the licensing terms for the
    {{{http://www.grouplens.org/node/73}MovieLens ML100K data set}},
    which is automatically downloaded and used by the demo
    evaluations.
