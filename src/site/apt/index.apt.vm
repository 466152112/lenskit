About LensKit

  LensKit is an open-source implementation of recommender algorithms
  with an emphasis on collaborative filtering.  It is developed by
  {{{http://www.grouplens.org}GroupLens Research}}.

  LensKit is currently beta softare (see
  {{{./versioning.html}Versioning}} for more information).  Please
  download it, try it out, and provide us with feedback on how it
  works for you, but be advised that it is still very much a
  work-in-progress and APIs may change as we gain more experience with
  them and the project stabilizes.

Project Goals

  LensKit is intended to be a reference implementation of common
  collaborative filtering algorithms and a useful starting point for
  recommender systems research and education.

  To support education, we place an emphasis on clean, readable code
  that demonstrates what is necessary to take algorithms from
  mathematical descriptions to actual implementation. LensKit is
  currently in a beta state, so the code does not yet live up to this
  standard.  As development progresses, we will be auditing the code
  for readability and documenting it more carefully.  The goal is to
  have the implementation be ready for use in courses on adaptive web
  and recommender technologies or for self-study on recommender
  implementation.

  We also intend LensKit to be a good platform for experimenting with
  new algorithms and evaluation metrics.  There are several specific
  design goals we have to further this objective:

  * A common recommender API covering item rating prediction and item
    recommendation in both rated and rating-free contexts.

    <<Status>>: The rating-based APIs are in place and seem
    to work pretty well.  The rating-free APIs still need development.

  * A highly modular implementation of common algorithms with
    state-of-the-art normalizations and tweaks.  This will provide
    easy access to high-quality implementations of existing algorithms
    to use as a baseline for evaluating new algorithms and a framework
    for testing modifications to individual components of algorithms
    (e.g. testing a new similarity function for item-item
    collaborative filtering).

    <<Status>>: The framework for this is in place and we
    have modular implementations of user-user and item-item
    collaborative filtering.  We also have a gradient descent SVD
    implementation that has not yet had as much refinement.

  * A comprehensive benchmarking tool capable of evaluating any
    compatible recommender algorithm using a variety of offline
    evaluation methods and metrics.

    <<Status>>: We have a leave-N-out crossfold benchmarker
    and the beginnings of a benchmarking framework.  Significant
    further development is needed on this goal.

* Non-goals

  LensKit is not intended to be an industry-strength implementation
  capable of running on a large e-commerce site (although we don't
  mind at all if you use it for that).  It is intended to be useful at
  research and education scales and suitable for providing
  recommendations in small- to medium-scale web applications.

  In particular, distributed recommender implementations are
  out-of-scope for LensKit â€” we are focusing on building high-quality
  single-process (but potentially multi-threaded) implementations.

Getting LensKit

  The easiest way to get LensKit is through Maven by adding it as a
  dependency; see the {{{./getting-started.html}Getting Started
  guide}} for more information.  We also provide LensKit binaries with
  all dependencies in both
  {{{./lenskit-package/lenskit-${project.version}.tar.gz}tar.gz}} and
  {{{./lenskit-package/lenskit-${project.version}.zip}zip}} formats.
  The JavaDoc is browseable {{{./apidocs}here}}.

  Alternatively, you can download the source code as a
  {{{./downloads/lenskit-${project.version}-source-package.tar.gz}gzipped
  tar archive}} or a
  {{{./downloads/lenskit-${project.version}-source-package.zip}zip
  file}} or get the sources from
  {{{http://bitbucket.org/grouplens/lenskit}BitBucket}}.
