Versioning and API change policy

  Until LensKit reaches version 1.0, APIs are liable to change.

  Once LensKit reaches 1.0, we will be making certain guarantees about
  the stability of certain interfaces. Component types and interfaces
  are labelled with their compatibility (using the <<<@compat>>> JavaDoc
  tag). Since LensKit APIs are intended both to be used and extended or
  implemented, compatibility also depends on the use case.

  LensKit version numbers have three components, <Major.Minor.Patch>. The
  versioning is based on {{{http://semver.org}Semantic Versioning}}, adapted
  for the needs of a framework and toolkit.

  We define the following use cases:

  [Clients] Client code is code that uses the LensKit APIs and algorithms
  to provide recommendation services. It does not implement any LensKit
  interfaces, other than perhaps the DAO.

  [Implementers] Implementation code implements various LensKit APIs to provide
  new algorithms. It may implement individual components of existing algorithms,
  or reuse their components.

  [Extenders] Extension code is level most closely coupled to LensKit's internals.
  This is code that derives from the classes inside LensKit algorithm implementations,
  is closely tied to them (re-implementing particularly internal components, etc.),
  or extends the evaluator.

  * For all components, binary- and source-incompatible changes will result in
    at least a point version increase (1.x). 1.x.y releases, where y>1, will only
    be bug fixes.

  * Client code may need to update its recommender configurations across minor (1.x)
    releases, but we will seek to minimize these changes and clearly document
    any necessary changes in the release notes.

  * Types designated “Compatibility: Public” will only have source- or binary-incompatible
    changes for client code in new major releases of LensKit. Incompatible changes for
    implementers or extenders will be associated with new minor versions and clearly
    identified in the release notes.
