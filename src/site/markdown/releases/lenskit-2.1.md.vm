## General Changes

-   Added `lenskit-all` module so you can easily depend on all of LensKit with a single
    dependency.

## Data Access

-   New methods to more easily construct DAOs (#issue(346))

-   `Rating` class now has `hasValue()` and `getValue()` methods for convenience.


## Configuration

-   Added `LenskitRecommenderEngineBuilder` and `LenskitRecommenderEngineLoader`.

    * Better interface for configuring build & load of recommender engines.

    * Allow multiple configurations to contribute to an engine.

    * Allow configurations to be removed (to remove e.g. DAOs from the model graph) and re-added
      to support building & serializing a model with one data access config and loading it with
      a different one.


-   Added `addComponent` methods to configuration contexts (#issue(457))

-   RNG now configured via dependency injection.

-   Fixed class loader problems with deserializing recommender models (#issue(434)).


## Algorithms

-   Updated user-user CF to be simpler & make better use of new DAOs (#issue(356)).

-   Refactored item-item model build:

    - Build the context with a provider rather than injecting a factory.

    - Use the strategy pattern to abstract sparse vs. non-sparse iteration, allowing sparse
      iteration to be disabled by overriding the default provider.

    - Better logging of the item-item model build process.

## Evaluator

-   The evaluator now supports loading algorithms from config files in both train-test
    and graph dumping tasks (#issue(406)).

-   In single-threaded mode, run eval tasks on the same thread as the evaluator (#issue(426)).

## Utilities

-   Remove `TaskGroupRunner` in favor of new `TaskGroup` class.
