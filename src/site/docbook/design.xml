  <section>
    <title>Design Goals</title>

    <para>LensKit's design is driven by three primary goals:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Clarity.</emphasis> LensKit should embody a clean,
        straightforward but not naïve implementation of a recommender system
        based on several algorithms.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem id="goal-modularity">
        <para><emphasis>Modularity.</emphasis> LensKit's architecture and
        algorithm implementations should be flexible and reconfigurable so
        that new algorithm configurations can be assembled from the pieces of
        existing algorithms. Algorithm pieces, such as normalizers and
        similarity functions, should be loosely coupled so that they can be
        reused with other algorithms.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Efficiency.</emphasis> LensKit should be efficient,
        capable of running on significant data sets with reasonable hardware
        requirements. Efficiency should not, however, come at the expense of
        readability.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>High-Level Design Decisions</title>

    <para>This section documents several high-level design and technology
    selection decisions for the LensKit architecture and code base.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Java Platform</title>

      <para>LensKit is implemented in Java 1.6. Several reasons contributed to
      our selection of Java as the implementation language and
      platform.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Approachability.</emphasis> Java is a widely-known
          language, so a Java implementation will be understandable by a large
          number of programmers and students. Implementing in Java allows the
          code to be usable in a variety of educational settings and opens it
          to use and extension by students, researchers, and other software
          developers.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Performance.</emphasis> The Java virtual machine has
          a high-quality optimizing compiler, allowing us to achieve good
          performance with straightforward code if we take some care in our
          choice of data structures and code structure.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Primitive Collections — Fastutil</title>

      <para>Java's data model does not allow generic types, such as data
      structures, to be parameterized over primitive types. Therefore code
      wishing to store primitive types in collections must first box them into
      the corresponding object types. For a package like LensKit which makes
      extensive use of large collections of longs, doubles, and other
      primitives, this boxing exacts a significant penalty both in memory use
      and execution time as the memory allocator and garbage collector must
      work noticably harder. We use the <ulink
      url="http://fastutil.dsi.unimi.it/">Fastutil</ulink> library of
      primitive collections extensively to be able to use high-level data
      structures, such as sets, maps, and lists, without the memory and
      performance penalty of boxing most numbers. This allows us to achieve
      good performance without using and managing arrays directly all the
      time.</para>

      <para>There are several primitive collection libraries around, such as
      PCJ and GNU Trove. We selected Fastutil because it supports generics
      where appropriate and takes advantage of Java 5 features to provide a
      clean API. Further, Fastutil classes implement the relevant Java
      Collections interfaces so it is easy to integrate with code written
      against the Java Collections API.</para>

      <para>While Fastutil is used internally extensively, the APIs are
      designed so that client code that only wants to use LensKit for
      recommendation is not required to use Fastutil to interface with
      recommenders and predictors. This also makes it easier to integrate
      LensKit with other APIs that produce standard Java collections. When
      collection objects are a Fastutil collection, however, the
      implementations generally take advantage of that and avoid temporary
      boxing.</para>

      <para>We have also written some new primitive collection classes and
      utilities. Some provide complete new primitive collections like
      Fastutil's implementation does (such as
      <literal>LongArraySortedSet</literal>), while others are entirely new
      data structures (like <literal>SparseVector</literal>).</para>

    <section id="id-dependency-injection">
      <title>Dependency Injection</title>

      <para>In order to make the <link
      linkend="goal-modularity">modularity</link> LensKit intends to achieve
      useful, we need a mechanism for assembling a collection of components to
      make a complete recommender. As an example of the kind of configuration
      we need to achieve, consider the process of building an item-item
      collaborative filtering model. The model builder requires access to the
      ratings data, a similarity function, a normalization strategy, and other
      parameters such as the number of neighbors to retain.</para>

      <para>One solution to this problem is to use constructor parameters. The
      model builder exposes a constructor that requires each of the components
      necessary to be passed in as a parameter. If we want to construct a
      model builder, we can instantiate each of the components and then
      construct a model builder with them. This can get tedious, as each of
      the components may in turn depend on other components, but it is
      possible and quite flexible. It further allows for unit testing, as each
      piece is broken down into subcomponents and stub implementations can be
      easily inserted.</para>

      <para>This technique is a design pattern called <emphasis>dependency
      injection</emphasis>. Each component declares the components it depends
      on by requiring them as constructor parameters. Then, rather than having
      the component itself directly instantiate or access its dependencies, it
      access the objects passed in to its constructor. The code instantiating
      the component is therefore responsible for selecting which
      implementation of its various dependencies are intended to be used. If
      it needs to construct many instances of some dependency, then it can
      declare a depency on a factory or provider object which creates
      instances.</para>

      <para>Dependency injection allows us to have completely reconfigurable
      recommenders, but without some additional assistance it requires a
      complex sequence of setup code to even be able to use a recommender.
      This is where dependency injection frameworks or containers come in.
      These frameworks allow the programmer to configure which implementations
      are to be used to satisfy dependencies on various interfaces and
      abstract classes, handle transitive dependency resolution, and take care
      of all the difficult work in building up trees of objects. After setting
      up the framework with the desired configuration, code then asks the
      framework to give it an instance of the desired object and the framework
      builds the object with all its dependencies.</para>

      <para>We use the <ulink
      url="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Guice</ulink> dependency
      injection framework in LensKit. Guice is a commonly-used framework which
      does its configuration entirely in Java, using a combination of
      annotations and Java configuration classes called
      <emphasis>modules</emphasis>. Annotations let us carefully describe
      dependencies, including making numeric and string parameters
      dependencies to be managed by Guice, and provide defaults for many of
      the extensible aspects of the LensKit architecture. In order to use
      LensKit, then, it is merely necessary to create a Guice module that
      describes the recommender configuration desired. We provide
      reconfigurable default modules for each of the recommender algorithms we
      provide, so using standard algorithms is very easy. LensKit can further
      be entirely reconfigured through more advanced use of Guice.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Strategy Pattern</title>

      <para>In LensKit, we often encounter situations where there are several
      approaches to a particular piece of code. One example of this is the
      method for filling in the item-item similarity matrix for item-based
      collaborative filtering: if the similarity function is symmetric, we can
      loop over a triangular section of the matrix and treat item pairs as
      unordered, while an asymmetric simialrity function requires considering
      item pairs as ordered and iterating over the entire matrix. Another
      example is in user-user collaborative filtering ― the high-level
      structure is always the same (find neighbors, then aggregate), but
      different neighborhood-finding strategies are possible.</para>

      <para>There are a couple of ways of implementing this effect:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Create an abstract class containing the common logic and put
          the replacable logic in an abstract method to be implemented in
          derived classes for the various strategies.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Use the <ulink
          url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern"><emphasis>strategy
          pattern</emphasis></ulink>, a design pattern in which the replacable
          code is defined via an interface, with the different strategies
          implementing that interface. The interface is then used via
          composition in class implementing the common logic.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>In LensKit, we prefer the strategy pattern. Composing strategies
      works very well with dependency injection as the user-user recommender
      can simply depend on the neighborhood-finding strategy. It also makes
      the code more explicit at the call site, as it is clear that the method
      implementing the strategy resides elsewhere and is pluggable, as opposed
      to an abstract method where the method's declaration must be consulted
      to see that it is intended to be overridden.</para>

      <para>The current LensKit code is not yet consistent in its use of this
      choice, but we are working on making it more so. Additionally, this
      design decision is not a hard-and-fast rule. If it clearly makes more
      sense to use inheritance than composition for a particular class,
      readability and understandability should trump inordinate
      consistency.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Logging Framework — SLF4J</title>

      <para>In LensKit, we use the <ulink url="http://www.slf4j.org">Simple
      Logging Facade for Java (<acronym>SLF4J</acronym>)</ulink> logging
      framework. This allows LensKit to emit log messages independent of the
      actual logging library used in the surrounding code. It can be cleanly
      integrated with applications using Log4J, standard Java logging, Jakarta
      Commons logging, or Logback. Applications included with LensKit use
      <ulink url="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</ulink> as the logging
      backend.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Build and Dependency Management — Maven</title>

      <para>LensKit uses <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org">Apache
      Maven</ulink> as its build system. This provides full dependency
      management in the build system, so we do not need to include library
      JARs in our version control or maintain them (and their dependencies)
      ourself. It also makes it easy to use LensKit in other projects, as
      Maven automatically fetches the appropriate version of LensKit from the
      Maven central repositories — all that a client application needs to do
      is declare a dependency on the LensKit packages it uses in its Maven POM
      file.</para>

      <para>Maven does come with some additional complexity, and can at times
      be difficult to configure. Basic projects, however, can be created and
      managed very easily. Additionally, LensKit can be easily used in
      projects built with Ant by using <ulink
      url="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/">Ivy</ulink>, a dependency management
      extension to Ant that can load dependencies from Maven
      repositories.</para>

      <para>Maven also provides us with a unified framework for handling
      project reporting and building the project web site with integrated
      JavaDoc, hyperlinked source code, and reports such as package
      dependencies, software licenses, and static code analysis.</para>
