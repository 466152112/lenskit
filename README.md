# LensKit

LensKit is an implementation of collaborative filtering algorithms and
a set of tools for benchmarking them.  This readme is about working with
the LensKit source code.  For more information about
LensKit and its documentation, visit the [web site][] or [wiki][].  You 
can also find information on the [wiki][] about how to use LensKit 
without downloading the source code.  If this is your first time working
with LensKit we recommend checking out the [Getting Started][] guide.

LensKit is made available under the GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL), version 2.1 or later.

## Installation and Dependency Management

LensKit is built and deployed via [Maven][].  To install it, check out
this repository and run `mvn install`; it is then available to other projects by
depending directly on it as above (consult `pom.xml` for the version to use; all LensKit
modules share the same version).  The source code can also be checked out and used
in most Java IDEs; NetBeans in IntelliJ both include Maven support, and the [m2e][]
plugin for Eclipse (installable from the Eclipse Marketplace) allows the project to
be opened in Eclipse. (More details on using Eclipse with LensKit are below.)

## Modules

LensKit is comprised of several modules.  The top-level `lenskit`
module serves as a container to build them and provide common settings
and dependencies.  The other modules are as follows:

* `lenskit-api` -- the common, public recommender API exposed by LensKit, independent
  of its actual implementations.
* `lenskit-data-structures` -- common data structures used by LensKit.
  These are split from `-core` so the API can depend on them.
* `lenskit-core` -- the core support code and configuration facilities for
  the rest of LensKit. It is the entry point for most of what you want to do with
  LensKit, providing support for configuring and building recommenders.
* `lenskit-knn` -- k-NN recommenders (user-user and item-item collaborative
  filtering).
* `lenskit-svd` -- the FunkSVD recommender (and eventually real SVD recommenders).
* `lenskit-slopeone` -- Slope-One recommenders.
* `lenskit-eval` -- the evaluation framework and APIs, along with a command line
  evaluation runner.
* `lenskit-eval-demo` -- a set of example scripts for configuring and running LensKit
  offline evaluations.
* `lenskit-package` -- a metapackage for preparing binary distributions, including
  scripts for running the evaluator.
* `lenskit-archetype-fancy-analysis` and `lenskit-archetype-simple-analysis` -- archetypes for creating user projects using LensKit.
  
## Contributing to LensKit
  
We welcome contribution to LensKit.  If you are looking for something
to work on, we recommend perusing the open tickets on our [Trac][wiki]
or asking on the [mailing list][].

We prefer to receive code submissions as BitBucket pull requests.  To
do this:

1. Fork the LensKit repository (`grouplens/lenskit`) on BitBucket
2. Push your changes to your fork
3. Submit a pull request via the BitBucket web interface
   
When submitting a pull request via BitBucket, you warrant that you
either own the code or have appropriate authority to submit it, and
license your changes under LensKit's copyright license (LGPLv2.1+).

## Notes for Eclipse

If you want to work with the LensKit sources in Eclipse, the checkout is complicated a bit
by limitations in M2e's integration with Mercurial. You'll need the Maven support ([m2e][]),
[MercurialEclipse][HGE] plugin, and the Groovy development tools (at least to work with the
evaluator code).  

First: do Help / Check for Updates and install any updates that are available.  We have had
problems in which the tool versions were not compatible with the Eclipse version, and those
problems can be frustrating to debug.  To get the tools:

* Maven.  Do Help / About / Installation Details / Features and check if m2e is already installed.
  It comes with many modern eclipse distros.  If not use Help / Marketplace, and search for Maven
  or m2e.
* Mercurial: Help / Marketplace and search for MercurialEclipse.  Install the option for 
  your version of Eclipse.
* Groovy: Help / Marketplace and search for Groovy.  It's fine to install the full version 
  including Grails from springsource, but all you need is
  Groovy-Eclipse, which is smaller and less intrusive.
 
Then do the following:

* Check out the LensKit source tree by selecting File / Import / "Clone existing repository".
  Enter the repository URL (the master repository is at `http://bitbucket.org/grouplens/lenskit`)
  and your BitBucket authentication information (if you want to be able to push), and clone the
  repository into your workspace.
* Once the project is imported, right-click it and select "Configure" -> "Convert to Maven project"
  to activate Maven support on the LensKit parent project.
* Finally, right-click the `lenskit` project, choose "Import", and select "Maven" / "Existing
  Maven Projects". Choose all sub-projects of `lenskit` and import them.

The `lenskit-eval` project requires some additional attention to compile correctly in Eclipse:

* First, right-click the `lenskit-eval` project and select "Configure" -> "Convert to 
  Groovy project" to enable Groovy support.
* Next, right-click the `lenskit-eval` project and select "Properties" / "Build Path" /
  "Link Source".
* In the window that appears, select the "Browse..." button and browse to the directory that
  contains the `lenskit` project. Then, select "lenskit-eval" / "src" / "main" / "groovy".
  You may change the suggested folder name if you wish, then click "finish".
* Finally, click the "Link Source..." button a second time and browse to "lenskit-eval" / 
  "src" / "test" / "groovy". Make sure that this folder has a different name than the first
  Groovy folder, and click "Finish" -> "OK".  
  
You will now have all components of LensKit imported and ready to edit and compile in Eclipse.

You can run Maven from Eclipse by right clicking on one of the pom.xml files, and selecting
"Build".  You can choose the goal you want to run, and it should directly run.  Note that you
will probably get the error message:

SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.

while appears to be harmless.

Mercurial on Windows is sometimes a little tricky to get set up.  If
you do not have a Mercurial.ini file, Mercurial will not know the user
name to use for commits.  Fortunately, this has been
[covered on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2329023/mercurial-error-abort-no-username-supplied).

You will need to install a Java Development Kit to build some parts of
LensKit.  On Linux or Mac, setting the Java HOME will let LensKit find
it. On Windows if you install the JDK next to the JRE, LensKit will
probably be able to find it.

The `etc/eclipse-codestyle.xml` file contains an Eclipse code style
that will configure most of the LensKit style guidelines.  See the
[Code Guidelines][] for more details on our coding style.

[Code Guidelines]: https://bitbucket.org/grouplens/lenskit/wiki/CodeGuidelines

Eclipse and IntelliJ disagree about some uses of @SuppressWarnings.  You can
ask Eclipse not to nag you about uses of @SuppressWarnings that it considers
unnecessary by following directions at this StackOverflow discussion:

## LensKit Archetypes

These archetypes are to build simple
(`lenskit-archetype-simple-analysis`) or more sophisticated
(`lenskit-archetype-fancy-analysis`) projects for doing analysis of
recommender algorithms.  Detailed information about using these
archetypes are in the src/main/resources/archetype-resources/Readme.md
file, which are installed in the top-level directory when a user uses
this archetype to generate a project.

* Be careful editing the pom in src/main/resources/archetype-resources, 
  because its variables are substituted
  at two different times.  Variables like ${project.version} are
  substituted at the time the archetype is run by a user to create a
  project.  Variables with backslashes in front of them like
  \${version} are left as variables by the archetype, so they can be
  substituted at project build time.
