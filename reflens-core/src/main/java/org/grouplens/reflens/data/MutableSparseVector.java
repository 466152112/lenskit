 * Mutable sparse vector interface
 * @author Michael Ekstrand <ekstrand@cs.umn.edu>
 * 
 * <p>This extends the sparse vector with support for imperative mutation
 * operations on their values, but
 * once created the set of keys remains immutable.  Addition and subtraction are
 * supported.  Mutation operations also operate in-place to reduce the
 * reallocation and copying required.  Therefore, a common pattern is:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MutableSparseVector normalized = MutableSparseVector.copy(vector);
 * normalized.subtract(normFactor);
 * </pre>
