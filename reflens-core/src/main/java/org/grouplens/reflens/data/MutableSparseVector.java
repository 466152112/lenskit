 * Mutable sparse vector interface

 *

 * operations on their values, but
 * once created the set of IDs is immutable.  Addition and subtraction are
 * supported.  Mutation operations also operate in-place to reduce the
 * reallocation and copying required.  Therefore, a common pattern is:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * MutableSparseVector normalized = vector.copy();
 * normalized.subtract(normFactor);
 * </pre>
