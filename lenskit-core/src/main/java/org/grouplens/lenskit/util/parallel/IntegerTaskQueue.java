/**
 * A task queue that returns (long) integer task IDs.
 *
 * This task queue represents tasks as consecutive, increasing integer IDs,
 * starting with 0.  All active iterators are considered threads, and each one
 * returns the next global task ID.  This allows multiple threads to start up,
 * each one to start an iterator loop overthe task queue, and the work to get
 * done.  Updates are done atomically so the whole thing is lock-free on good
 * hardware.
