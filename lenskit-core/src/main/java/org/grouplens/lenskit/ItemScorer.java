/**

 * This method provides two flavors of score methods: those that take a user ID,
 * loading data from the database as appropriate, and those that take a user
 * history.  Some recommenders may ignore the history and use data pre-computed
 * in a model for the user.  The {@link #canUseHistory()} method allows client
 * code to query whether the history can actually be used by the underlying
 * recommender.  Both methods will work, but if {@link #canUseHistory()} returns
 * <tt>false</tt>, then the history-based methods will be equivalent to calling
 * the ID-based methods.
