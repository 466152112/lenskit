/**
 * Normalizes against the variance of the vector with optional smoothing as described
 * 	in Hofmann '04. 
 * 
 * The normalization assumes that a user's mean rating and variance are independent of
 * 	actual preferences, and attempts to describe the preference of a rating by the
 * 	distance of the rating from the mean, relative to the user's normal rating variance.
 * 
 * The smoothing factor helps to smooth out results for users with fewer ratings by
 * 	re-weighting the user's rating variance. The 'smoothing number' is a number of
 * 	'default' ratings to give the user, weighting the user's variance towards the
 * 	average community variance. Accordingly, set smoothing = 0 (or use default
 * 	constructor) for no smoothing. The 'global variance' parameter only pertains to
 * 	smoothing, and is unnecessary otherwise.
