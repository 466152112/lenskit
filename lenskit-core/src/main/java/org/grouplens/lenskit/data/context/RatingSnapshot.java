/**
 * Snapshot of the ratings data for building a recommender.
 * 
 * <p>The recommender build process often needs to take multiple passes over
 * the rating data.  In a live system, the data provided by a
 * {@link RatingDataAccessObject} may change between iterations.  Therefore,
 * we introduce <emph>build contexts</emph> &mdash; snapshots of the rating data
 * at a particular point in time that can be iterated as many times as necessary
 * to build the recommender.
 * 
 * <p>Implementers have a variety of options for implementing build contexts.
 * They can be in-memory snapshots, database transactions, database clones,
 * or even disk files.  Recommender build code does assume, however, that
 * multiple iterations is pretty fast.  Therefore, implementations should avoid
 * re-fetching the data over a network connection for each request.
 * 
 * <p>An additional feature provided by build contexts is that of mapping the
 * item and user IDs to consecutive, 0-based indices.  The indices <strong>may 
 * differ</strong> from one build context to another.
 * 
 * <p>The build context will usually be a singleton in a dedicated
 * recommender-building process or an appropriately scoped object in other
 * contexts.
