/**
 * LensKit data access objects.
 *
 * <p>LensKit uses <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/DataAccessObject.html">Data Access Objects</a>
 * to obtain access to rating data.  These objects allow LensKit to query for
 * users, items, ratings, etc.  DAOs correspond generally to database connections
 * or their equivalent, so they should only be used in a single thread.  When
 * threads need to be able to create DAOs, {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.data.dao.DAOFactory} objects
 * should be used.
 *
 * <p>The data access object makes no transactional or immutability guarantees,
 * and does not provide mutation.  An implementation is, of course, free to
 * provide mutation.  The recommender building process uses a
 * {@link org.grouplens.lenskit.data.snapshot.RatingSnapshot RatingSnapshot}
 * so that it can make multiple passes over a snapshot of the data.
