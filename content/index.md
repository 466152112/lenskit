# The LensKit Recommender Toolkit

LensKit is an open source toolkit for building, researching, and
studying recommender systems.

## Build

Do you  need a  recommender for your  next project?   LensKit provides
high-quality implementations of  well-regarded collaborative filtering
algorithms and is  designed for integration into  web applications and
other similarly complex environments.

## Research

Do you want to experiment with new recommender algorithms or
evaluation strategies?  LensKit provides infrastructure to manage
configuration, data access, and the model build process, and allows
you to easily compare your new algorithm against high-quality
implementations of existing well-accepted algorithms.

## Study

LensKit's source code is freely available under an open source license
and is suitable for self-study or use in classroom settings.  Our goal
is to produce readable, straightforward implementations that achieve
good performance while at the same time serving as executable
documentation for how to turn recommender algorithms from math to
code, as well as a working example of how to deal with the details
necessary to connect recommenders to databases, manage models and
configuration, and integrate them into web-based environments.

## License

[LGPL]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html

LensKit is licensed under the
[GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later][LGPL].  The
libraries it depends on are released under either the LGPL, the Apache
Public License, or a broadly permissive license such as the MIT
license.

This means that you can freely use LensKit in any project.  If you
distribute software that includes LensKit, you must provide the
LensKit source code and make any modifications you have made to
LensKit itself available under a compatible open source license.  Most
uses of LensKit don't involve distributing software, though; if you're
building a recommender into your web site or application, you are
almost certainly not distributing software in a manner that triggers
the requirements of the LGPL.

## Acknowledgements

LensKit is made possible by support from a number of organizations:

- Other GroupLens projects use it (particularly [MovieLens][] and [BookLens][]), providing experience, bug reports, and other valuable feedback (and code).
- Development has been funded in part by the National Science foundation (under grants IIS 05-34939, 08-08692, 08-12148, and 10-17697).
- YourKit is kindly supporting the project with free licenses for the [YourKit Java profiler](http://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/index.jsp).
