We've now released LensKit 2.0.1, a minor bugfix release in the LensKit 2.0 series.  This brings the following improvements:

- Fix bug in `lenskit-eval --version`
- Improve layout and comments of sample code in `lenskit-archetype-fancy-analysis`
- Fix bug in fancy archetype where `target/data` doesn't exist
- Add missing annotation to `SimpleRatingPredictor`'s primary item scorer (this should not cause any compatibility problems, unless you bind unqualified `ItemScorer` and `@PrimaryScorer ItemScorer` to different implementations).

See the [release notes](/maven-site/releases/lenskit-2.0.1.html) for further links and details.
