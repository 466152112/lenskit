[release notes]: ../maven-site/releases/lenskit-2.0.3.html

LensKit 2.0.3.1 is now available.  The [release notes][] contain more details.

This release contains bugfixes, as well as the beginnings of Top-N evaluation capabilities.  See the [Evaluator manual page](https://github.com/grouplens/lenskit/wiki/Evaluator) for information on using these new evaluation features.


2.0.3.1 has a fix for one small bug that was discovered after 2.0.3 was tagged and pushed.  The archetype indexes won't be up-to-date until Sunday, but the archetypes are unchanged.  You can generate a 2.0.3 project and update `lenskit.version` to 2.0.3.1.

Enjoy!
