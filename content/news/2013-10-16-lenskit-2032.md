We've pushed a critical bugfix release for LensKit, so the latest version is now 2.0.3.2.  Fixes:

- Metrics now report no value rather than NaN when there are no users they could test (e.g. predict metrics on a Top-N-only algorithm)
- Pearson correlation now correctly subtracts the mean of common ratings, not mean of all ratings, for each user.
