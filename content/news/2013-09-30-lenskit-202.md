[release notes]: ../maven-site/releases/lenskit-2.0.2.html

We have now released LensKit 2.0.2, a second bugfix release in the LensKit 2.0 series.  The [release notes][] contain more details.

Highlights:

- Fix a zombie thread bug in the evaluator so it actually terminates when it's done
- Make it easier to create empty user histories (`History.forUser(long)`)
- Fix null pointer exceptions when scorers score for nonexistent users

With this release, we have also moved from Mercurial and BitBucket to Git and [GitHub](http://github.com/grouplens/lenskit).  Any new bugs should be filed there.

We pushed the release to Maven Central on Saturday, so it should be propagated to mirrors now (including the archetype metadata).  Get binary distributions from the [downloads page](../downloads/).
